# Hi, Iâ€™m Alexandra Rocchi. Welcome to my GitHub profile :woman_technologist:
**Front-end developer**

I started my career as a Graphic Designer, and in 2015 I decided to alter my course by taking a Master's degree in Madrid to become a front-end developer. Today I am happy to have made that decision because I love what I do, the challenges I encounter along the way, and how to overcome them. I am currently part of a great team of developers with whom we carry out amazing and interesting projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular and improving my JavaScript level. I want to take advantage of this space to be able to share with you my learning and personal challenges.
