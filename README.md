# Hi there! My name is Alexandra Rocchi. Welcome to my GitHub profile :woman_technologist:
**Front-end developer**

I'm a front-end developer with five years of experience working on multiple projects. Throughout my career, I've worked with a variety of tools such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and have developed on platforms like Hybris, AEM, and Liferay. Before diving into the world of development, I worked as a graphic designer, which has given me an edge when it comes to aesthetics and usability in my projects. I'm passionate about web development and am constantly learning new techniques and technologies to further improve my skills.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in web application development using various JavaScript frameworks, including Angular, React, and Vue. I want to take advantage of this space to be able to share with you my learning and personal challenges.
